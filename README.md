### CNN Model TODO:
- train models.

### NEW METRIC IDEA
- Try plotting fouling percentage or percentage of black pixels in target against f1 score or jaccard index for each sample.
- Why? Because this will give an idea of what kinds of targets are too difficult for the model to replicate.
- Therefore, is a good judge of how well the model performs on extremely difficult samples.

### Rain Data Problem 
- Rain data is difficult to make synthetic data from.
- Consider a new data synthesis method for making rainy data.
