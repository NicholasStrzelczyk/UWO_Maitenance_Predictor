----- USE THIS TO KEEP TRACK OF DIFFERENCES FOR EACH MODEL -----

Model 1:
    - deleted

Model 2:
    - retry of initial model (also 10 epochs)
    - no clear sign of overfitting

Model 3:
    - 25 epochs
    - trying to see at what point overfitting occurs
    - will use this model for initial testing
