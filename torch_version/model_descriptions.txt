----- USE THIS TO KEEP TRACK OF DIFFERENCES FOR EACH MODEL -----

Model 1:
    - Trained on Tuesday, July 2nd, 2024
    - Other models show issue with loss function.
    - This model attempts to resolve this by changing the class weights.
    - New weights are hard-coded as 0.75 for class 1 and 0.25 for class 0.
    - Trained for 20 epochs.

Model 2:
    - trained on Friday, June 28th, 2024
    - retry of initial model (also 10 epochs)
    - no clear sign of overfitting

Model 3:
    - trained on Sunday, June 30th, 2024
    - 25 epochs
    - trying to see at what point overfitting occurs
    - will use this model for initial testing
